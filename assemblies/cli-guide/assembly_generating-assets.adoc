= Generating platform assets for application deployment

:context: generating-assets

[role="_abstract"]
Generate static reports and deployment manifests with the {ProductFullName} CLI so you can share migration insights and deploy Cloud Foundry applications to {ocp-short}. Use the `discover` and `generate` commands in containerless mode.

You can use the `discover` and `generate` commands in containerless mode to automatically generate the manifests needed to deploy a Cloud Foundry (CF) application in the {ocp-short}: 

* Use the `discover` command to generate the discovery manifest in the YAML format directly from a CF instance or from either of the following manifest files:

** A single application manifest
** A CF manifest
** A path to the directory with multiple manifest files, for example, with application manifests, CF manifests, or both of these manifest types.

+
The discovery manifest preserves the specifications found in the CF manifest. The specifications define the metadata, runtime, and platform configurations. 

* Use the `generate` command to generate the deployment manifest for {ocp} deployments by using the discovery manifest. The deployment manifest is generated by using a templating engine, such as Helm, that converts the discovery manifest into a Kubernetes-native format. You can also use this command to generate non-Kubernetes manifests, such as a Dockerfile or a configuration file.

:FeatureName: Generating platform assets for application deployment

[IMPORTANT]
====
[subs="attributes+"]
{FeatureName} is a Developer Preview feature only. Developer Preview features are not supported by Red Hat in any way and are not functionally complete or production-ready. Do not use Developer Preview features for production or business-critical workloads. Developer Preview features provide early access to upcoming product features in advance of their possible inclusion in a Red Hat product offering, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process. These features might not have any documentation, are subject to change or removal at any time, and testing is limited. Red Hat might provide ways to submit feedback on Developer Preview features without an associated SLA.
====
:!FeatureName:

Generating deployment assets has the following benefits:

* Generating the Kubernetes and non-Kubernetes deployment manifests.   
* Generating deployment manifests by using familiar template engines, for example, Helm, that are widely used for Kubernetes deployments.
* Adhering to Kubernetes best practices when preparing the deployment manifest by using Helm templates.
