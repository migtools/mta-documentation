= Generating platform assets for application deployment

:context: generating-assets

Starting from {ProductShortName} version 7.3.0, you can use the `discover` and `generate` commands in containerless mode to automatically generate the manifests needed to deploy a Cloud Foundry (CF) application in the {ocp-short}: 

* Use the `discover` command to generate the discovery manifest in the YAML format directly from a CF instance or from either of the following manifest files:

** A single application manifest
** A CF manifest
** A path to the directory with multiple manifest files, for example, with application manifests, CF manifests, or both of these manifest types.

+
The discovery manifest preserves the specifications found in the CF manifest. The specifications define the metadata, runtime, and platform configurations. 

* Use the `generate` command to generate the deployment manifest for {ocp} deployments by using the discovery manifest. The deployment manifest is generated by using a templating engine, such as Helm, that converts the discovery manifest into a Kubernetes-native format. You can also use this command to generate non-Kubernetes manifests, such as a Dockerfile or a configuration file.

.Benefits of generating deployment assets

Generating deployment assets has the following benefits:

* Generating the Kubernetes and non-Kubernetes deployment manifests.   
* Generating deployment manifests by using familiar template engines, for example, Helm, that are widely used for Kubernetes deployments.
* Adhering to Kubernetes best practices when preparing the deployment manifest by using Helm templates.
