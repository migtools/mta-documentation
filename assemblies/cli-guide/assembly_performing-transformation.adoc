:context: performing-transformation

You can use transformation to perform the following actions:

* Transform Java applications source code by using the `transform openrewrite` command.
* Convert XML rules to YAML rules by using the `transform rules` command.

IMPORTANT: Performing transformation requires the container runtime to be configured.
