[role="_abstract"]
Create YAML rules and rulesets. Use conditions, actions, and providers to group rules that achieve a common goal.

A set of rules forms a ruleset. {ProductShortName} does not require every rule file to belong to a ruleset, but you can use rulesets to group multiple rules that achieve a common goal and to pass the rules to the rules engine.

To use multiple rule files, you can either:

* Place the rule files in a directory and  add a ruleset.yaml file. {ProductShortName} treats the directory as a ruleset, and you can pass the directory path as input to the `--rules` option.
* Specify multiple rules files by using the `--rules` option when you run an analysis.

Note that if you want to use the `--target` or `--source` option in the CLI, the engine will only select rules that match the label for that target. Therefore, make sure that you have added target or source labels on your rules. See xref:reserved-label_rule-yaml-metadata[Reserved labels] for more details.
