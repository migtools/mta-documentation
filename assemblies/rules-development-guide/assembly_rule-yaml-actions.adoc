You can use rule actions to generate information about the source code. The rule action information can be included in a violation or used to categorize the source code.

Rules can include the following types of actions:

* `Message`: use message action to display an informative message in the static report that contains the violation triggered by the rule. See xref:yaml-message-actions_rule-yaml-actions[Message action] for more information.
* `Tag`: use tags to categorize parts of the source code. For example, Backend=Java, where Backend is the key and Java is the value. See xref:yaml-tag-actions_rule-yaml-actions[Tag actions] for more information.
Each rule includes either one of them or both of them.
