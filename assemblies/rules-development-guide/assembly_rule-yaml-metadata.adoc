The rule metadata contains information about the migration defined by the Architect. You can use rule metadata to:

* Estimate the total migration effort. 
* Prioritize issues that must be resolved based on the effort.
* Evaluate if a resolution is mandatory through rule category before migrating the applications to the target technologies or platforms.
* Define labels used by {ProductShortName} to filter rules for an analysis.
