== Creating YAML rules

Each analyzer rule is a set of instructions that are used to analyze source code and detect issues that are problematic for migration.

The analyzer parses user-provided rules, applies them to applications' source code, and generates issues for matched rules.

A collection of one or more rules forms a ruleset. Creating rulesets provides a way of organizing multiple rules that achieve a common goal.

The analyzer CLI takes rulesets as input arguments.

=== Creating a basic YAML rule

This section describes how to create a basic {ProductShortName} YAML rule. This assumes that you already have {ProductShortName} installed. See the {ProductShortName} {ProductDocUserGuideURL}[_{UserCLIBookName}_] for installation instructions.
