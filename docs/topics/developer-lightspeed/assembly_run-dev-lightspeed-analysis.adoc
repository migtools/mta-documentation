= Running Developer Lightspeed analysis

:context: run-dev-lightspeed-analysis

[role="_abstract"]
After you configure Developer Lightspeed, run an analysis to identify issues and generate suggestions. Use {mta-dl-full} to get code fix suggestions and resolve migration issues.

When you run an analysis, {ProductShortName} displays the issues in the *Analysis Results* view.

When you request code fix suggestions, {mta-dl-plugin} performs the following tasks:

* Streams LLM messages that describe the issue description, resolution, and the file in which the updates are applied.
* Generates new files in the *Resolutions* pane. These files have the updates to the code to resolve the issues detected in the current analysis. You can review the changes, apply, or revert the updates.

If you apply all the resolutions, {mta-dl-plugin} applies the changes and triggers another analysis to check if there are more issues. Subsequent analysis reports fewer issues and incidents.
