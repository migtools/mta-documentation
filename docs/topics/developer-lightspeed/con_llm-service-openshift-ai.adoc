= Deploying an LLM as a service in an {ocp-name} AI cluster

[role="_abstract"]
The code suggestions from {mta-dl-full} differ based on the large language model (LLM) that you use. Therefore, you may want to use an LLM that caters to your specific requirements.

{mta-dl-plugin} integrates with LLMs that are deployed as a scalable service on {ocp-name} AI clusters. These deployments provide you with granular control over resources such as compute, cluster nodes, and auto-scaling Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) while enabling you to leverage LLMs to resolve code issues at a large scale.

An example workflow for configuring an LLM service on {ocp-name} AI broadly requires the following configurations:

* Installing and configuring the following infrastructure resources:
** {ocp-short} cluster and installing the {ocp-name} AI Operator
** Configure a GPU machineset
** (Optional) Configure an auto scaler custom resource (CR) and a machine scaler CR 
* Configuring {ocp-name} AI platform
** Configure a data science project
** Configure a serving runtime
** Configure an accelerator profile
* Deploying the LLM through {ocp-name} AI
** Uploading your model to an AWS compatible bucket
** Add a data connection
** Deploy the LLM in your {ocp-name} AI data science project
** Export the SSL certificate, `OPENAI_API_BASE` URL and other environment variables to access the LLM
* Preparing the LLM for analysis
** Configure an OpenAI API key
** Update the OpenAI API key and the base URL in `provider-settings.yaml`.

//See xref:ref_llm-provider-configurations.adoc[Configuring LLM provider settings] to configure the base URL and the LLM API key in the {mta-dl-plugin} VS Code extension.
