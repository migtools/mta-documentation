= Configuring the {mta-dl-plugin} IDE settings

After you install the {ProductShortName} extension in Visual Studio (VS) Code, you must provide your large language model (LLM) credentials to activate {mta-dl-plugin} settings in Visual Studio (VS) Code. 

{mta-dl-plugin} settings are applied to all AI-assisted analysis that you perform by using the {ProductShortName} extension. The extension settings can be broadly categorized into debugging and logging, {mta-dl-plugin} settings, analysis related settings, and solution server settings.

.Prerequisites

In addition to the overall prerequisites, you have configured the following:

* You completed the solution server configurations in Tackle custom resource if you opt to use the solution server.

.Procedure

. Go to the {mta-dl-plugin} settings in one of the following ways:
+
.. Click `Extensions > MTA CLI Extension for VSCode > Settings`
+
.. Type `Ctrl + Shift + P` or `Cmd + Shift + P` on the search bar to open the Command Palette and enter `Preferences: Open Settings (UI)`. Go to `Extensions > MTA` to open the settings page.
+
. Configure the settings described in the following table:

|Settings |Description
|Log level|Set the log level for the {ProductShortName} binary. The default log level is `debug`. The log level increases or decreases the verbosity of logs. 
|Analyzer path|Specify an {ProductShortName} custom binary path. If you do not provide a path, Developer Lightspeed for MTA uses the default path to the binary.
|Auto Accept on Save|This option is enabled by default. When you accept the changes suggested by the LLM, the updated code is saved automatically in a new file. Disable this option if you want to manually save the new file after accepting the suggested code changes.
|Gen AI:Enabled|This option is enabled by default. It enables you to get code fixes by using {mta-dl-plugin} with a large language model.
|Gen AI: Agent mode|Enable the experimental Agentic AI flow for analysis. {mta-dl-plugin} runs an automated analysis of a file to identify issues and suggest resolutions. After you accept the solutions, {mta-dl-plugin} makes the changes in the code and re-analyzes the file. 
|Gen AI: Excluded diagnostic sources|Add diagnostic sources in the `settings.json` file. The issues generated by such diagnostic sources are excluded from the automated Agentic AI analysis. 
|Cache directory|Specify the path to a directory in your filesystem to store cached responses from the LLM.
|Trace directory|Configure the absolute path to the directory that contains the saved LLM interaction.
|Trace enabled|Enable to trace {ProductShortName} communication with the LLM model. Traces are stored in the trace directory that you configured.
|Demo mode|Enable to run {mta-dl-plugin} in demo mode that uses the LLM responses saved in the `cache` directory for analysis.
|Solution Server:URL|Edit the configurations for solution server in `settings.json`:
 
                     * “enabled”: Enter a boolean value. Set `true` for connecting the Solution Server client ({mta-dl-plugin} extension) to the Solution Server.

                     * “url”: Configure the URL of the Solution Server end point. 

                     * “auth”: The authentication settings allows you to configure a list of options to authenticate to the solution server. 
                    ** "enabled": Set to `true` to enable authentication. If you enable authentication, then you must configure the Solution Server realm.

                    ** "insecure": Set to `true` to skip SSL certificate verification when clients connect to the Solution Server. Set to `false` to allow secure connections to the Solution Server.

                    ** "realm": Enter the name of the Keycloak realm for Solution Server. If you enabled authentication for the Solution Server, you must configure a link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_build_of_keycloak/26.0/html/server_administration_guide/red_hat_build_of_keycloak_features_and_concepts[Keycloak realm] to allow clients to connect to the Solution Server. An administrator can configure SSL for the realm.
|Debug:Webview|Enable debug level logging for Webview message handling in VS Code.
