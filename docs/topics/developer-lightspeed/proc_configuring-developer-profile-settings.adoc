= Configuring the {mta-dl-plugin} profile settings

To run an analysis using {mta-dl-plugin}, you must configure a profile that contains all the necessary configurations for an analysis, such as source and target technologies and API key to connect with your chosen large language model (LLM). 

.Prerequisites

* You installed the {ProductShortName} extension version 8.0.0 in Visual Studio (VS) Code. 
//need to check how the user provides LLM credentials and write a new proc if needed
* You provided LLM credentials to enable generative AI for the {ProductShortName} extension in `settings.json` file. 
* You installed the {ProductShortName} distribution version 8.0.0 in your system. 
* You installed the latest version of Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat extension in VS Code.
//check if users still need Java 17+ in their system since Language Support extension is already a req.
* You installed Jave 17+ and Maven 3.9.9+ in your system. 
* You opened a Java project in your VS Code workspace.

.Procedure

. Open the `Konveyor View Analysis` page in either of the following ways: 
+
.. Click the screen icon on the `Konveyor Issues` pane of the {ProductShortName} extension. 
.. Type `Ctrl + Shift + P` on the search bar to open the Command Palette and enter `Konveyor:Open Konveyor Analysis View`.
+
. Click the settings button on the `Konveyor View Analysis` page to configure a profile for your project.
The `Get Ready to Analyze` pane lists the follwoing basic configurations required for an analysis: 
+

.Verification

After you complete the profile configuration, close the `Get Ready to Analyze` pane. You can verify that your configuration works by running an analysis. See run an analysis.

|Profile settings |Description
|Select profile|Create a profile that you can reuse for multiple analyses. The profile name is part of the context provided to the LLM for analysis.  
|Configure label selector|A label selector filters rules for analysis based on the source or target technology.

Specify one or more target or source technologies (for example, cloud-readiness). {mta-dl-plugin} uses this configuration to determine the rules that are applied to a project during analysis. 

If you mentioned a new target or a source technology in your custom rule, you can type that name to create and add the new item to the list.

[NOTE]
====
You must configure either target or source tehcnologies before running an analysis.
====
|Set rules|Enable default rules and Select your custom rule that you want {mta-dl-plugin} to use for an analysis. You can use the custom rules in addition to the default rules.
|Configure generative AI|This option opens the `provider-settings.yaml` file that contains API keys and other parameters for all supported LLMs. By default, {mta-dl-plugin} is configured to use OpenAI LLM. To change the model, update the anchor `&active` to the desired block. Modify this file with the required arguments, such as the model and API key, to complete the setup.
