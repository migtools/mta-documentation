= Running an analysis in solution server mode

[role="_abstract"]
Solution server uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to extract a pattern of resolution that improves the context. {mta-dl-plugin} derives the context from rules, past changes to in the codebase ro resolve issues, and from migration hits created by the solution server by working with the large language model (LLM).  

{mta-dl-plugin} generates a prompt for your large language model (LLM) based on the derived context. The LLM generates suggestions to resolve issues identified by running the static code analysis. 

.Prerequisites

* You installed the {ProductShortName} distribution version 8.0.0 in your system.
* You installed Jave 17+ and Maven 3.9.9+ in your system. 
* You installed the {ProductFullName} extension version 8.0.0 in VS Code. 
* You installed the latest version of Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat extension in Visual Studio (VS) Code.
* You opened a Java project in your VS Code workspace.
//check what's the alternative for Konveyor references in the d/s build.
* You configured an analysis profile on the *Konveyor Analysis View* page.

.Procedure

. Verify that solution server is enabled in one of the following ways:
+
.. Type `Ctrl + Shift + P` in VS Code search (Linux/Windows system) and `Cmd + Shift + P` for Mac to go to the command palette. 
.. Enter `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)` to open the `settings.json` file.
.. Ensure that `konveyor.solutionServer.enabled` is set to `true`.
+
OR
+
.. Go to *Extensions > {mta-dl-plugin} > settings*
.. Click the *Solution Server:Enabled* option to enable the server. 
+
. Click the {mta-dl-plugin} extension and click *Open Konveyor Analysis View*.
+
. Select a profile for the analysis.
+
. Click *Start* to start the {ProductShortName} RPC server.
+
. Click *Run Analysis* on the  *Konveyor Analysis View* page.
