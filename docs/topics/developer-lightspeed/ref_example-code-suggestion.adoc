= Generating code fix suggestions 

[role="_abstract"]
This example will walk you through generating code fixes for a Java application that must be migrated to the target technology `quarkus`. To generate resolutions for issues in the code, we use the Agentic AI mode and the `my-model` as the large language model (LLM) that you deployed in {ocp-name} AI.

.Procedure

. Open the `my-Java` project in Visual Studio (VS) Code.

. Download the {mta-dl-full} extension from the link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=migration%20toolkit&target=VSCode&category=All%20categories&sortBy=Relevance[Visual Studio Code marketplace].

. Type `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows and Linux systems) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac systems).

. Type `Preferences: Open Settings (UI)` in the Command Palette to open the Visual Studio Code settings and select `Extensions > {ProductShortName}`.

. Select `Gen AI:Agent Mode`.

. In the {mta-dl-plugin} extension, click `Open Analysis View`.

. Type `MTA: Manage Analysis Profile` in the Command Palette and configure the following fields:

** *Profile Name*: Type a profile name

** *Target Technologies*: `quarkus`

** *Custom Rules*: Select custom rules if you want to include them while running the analysis. By default, {mta-dl-plugin} enables *Use Default Rules* for `quarkus`.

. Type `MTA: Open the Gen AI model provider configuration file` in the Command Palette to configure the following in the `provider-settings` file:
+
[source, yaml]
----
models:
  openshift-example-model: &active
    environment:
      OPENAI_API_KEY: "<Server's OPENAI_API_KEY>"
      CA_BUNDLE: "<Servers CA Bundle path>"
    provider: "ChatOpenAI"
    args:
      model: "my-model"
      configuration:
        baseURL: "https://<serving-name>-<data-science-project-name>.apps.konveyor-ai.example.com/v1"
----
+
[NOTE]
====
You must change the `provider-setting` configuration if you plan to use a different LLM provider.
====

. On the `{ProductShortName}: Open Analysis View` page, click *Start* to start the {ProductShortName} RPC server.

. Select the profile you configured and click *Run Analysis* to scan the Java application.
+
{ProductShortName} identifies the issues in the code.

. Click the solutions icon (image:solutions-icon-new.png[]) in an issue to request suggestions to resolve the issue.
+
{mta-dl-plugin} streams the issue description, a preview of the code changes that resolve the issue, and the file(s) in which the changes are to be made.
+
You can review the code changes in the editor and accept or reject the changes. If you accept the changes, {mta-dl-plugin} creates a new file with the accepted code changes.
+
. Click *Continue* to allow {mta-dl-plugin} to run a follow-up analysis. 
+
This round of analysis detects lint issues, compilation issues, or diagnostic issues that might have occurred when you accepted the suggested code change.
+
Repeat the review and accept or reject the resolutions. {mta-dl-plugin} continues to run repeated scan iterations if you allow it, until the tool resolves all issues.
