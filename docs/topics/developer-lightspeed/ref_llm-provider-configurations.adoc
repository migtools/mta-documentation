= Provider settings configuration

[role="_abstract"]
{mta-dl-full} is large language model (LLM) agnostic and intergrates with an LLM of your choice. 

To enable {mta-dl-full} to access your large language model (LLM), you must enter the LLM provider configurations in the `provider-settings.yaml` file. 

The `provider-settings.yaml` file contains a list of LLM providers that are suppored by default. The mandatory environment variables are different for each LLM provider. Depending on the provider that you choose, you can configure additional environment variables for a model in the `provider-settings.yaml` file. You can also enter a new provider with the required environment variables, the base URL, and the model name.

The provider settings file is available in the {mta-dl-plugin} Visual Studio (VS) Code extension.

Access the `provider-settings.yaml` from the VS Code Command Pallete by typing `Open the GenAI model provider configuration file`. 

You can select one provider from the list by using the `&active` anchor in the name of the provider. To use a model from another provider, move the `&active` anchor to the desired provider block and restart the solution server on the `Open {ProductShortName} Analysis View` screen.

For example, enter the following configurations for an OpenAI model:

[source, yaml]
----
OpenAI: &active
    environment:
      OPENAI_API_KEY: "<your-API-key>" # Required
    provider: ChatOpenAI
