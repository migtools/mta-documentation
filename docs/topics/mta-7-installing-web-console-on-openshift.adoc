[id="mta-7-installing-web-console-on-openshift_{context}"]

= Installing the {ProductName} {WebName}

You can install the {ProductName} ({ProductShortName}) {WebName} on all Red Hat OpenShift cloud services and Red Hat OpenShift self-managed editions.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To be able to create {ProductShortName} instances, you must first install the {ProductShortName} Operator.
====

The {ProductShortName} Operator is a structural layer that manages resources deployed on OpenShift, such as database, front end, and back end, to automatically create an {ProductShortName} instance.

[id="openshift-persistent-volume-requirements_{context}"]
== Persistent volume requirements

To successfully deploy, the {ProductShortName} Operator requires 2 RWO persistent volumes (PVs) used by different components. If the `rwx_supported` configuration option is set to `true`, the {ProductShortName} Operator requires an additional 2 RWX PVs that are used by Maven and the hub file storage. The PVs are described in the following table:

.Required persistent volumes

|Name
|Default size
|Access mode
|Description

|`hub database`
|`10Gi`
|RWO
|Hub database

|`hub bucket`
|`100Gi`
|RWX
|Hub file storage; required if the `rwx_supported` configuration option is set to `true`

|`keycloak postgresql`
|`1Gi`
|RWO
|Keycloak back end database

|`cache`
|`100Gi`
|RWX
|Maven m2 cache; required if the `rwx_supported` configuration option is set to `true`

[id="installing-mta-operator-and-ui_{context}"]
== Installing the {ProductName} Operator and the {WebName}

You can install the {ProductName} ({ProductShortName}) and the {WebName} on Red Hat OpenShift versions {ocp-supported}.

.Prerequisites

* 4 vCPUs, 8 GB RAM, and 40 GB persistent storage.
* Any cloud services or self-hosted edition of Red Hat OpenShift on versions {ocp-supported}.
* You must be logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` permissions.

For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift_operators[OpenShift Operator Life Cycles].

.Procedure

. In the Red Hat OpenShift web console, click *Operators → OperatorHub*.
. Use the *Filter by keyword* field to search for *MTA*.
. Click the *Migration Toolkit for Applications* Operator and then click *Install*.
. On the *Install Operator* page, click *Install*.
. Click *Operators → Installed Operators* to verify that the {ProductShortName} Operator appears in the `openshift-mta` project with the status `Succeeded`.
. Click the *{ProductShortName}* Operator.
. Under *Provided APIs*, locate *Tackle*, and click *Create Instance*.
+
The *Create Tackle* window opens in *Form* view.
. Review the custom resource (CR) settings. The default choices should be acceptable, but make sure to check the system requirements for storage, memory, and cores.
. To work directly with the YAML file, click *YAML* view and review the CR settings that are listed in the `spec` section of the YAML file.
+
The most commonly used CR settings are listed in this table:

[id="installing-mta-operator-in-disconnected-environment_{context}"]
== Installing the {ProductName} Operator in a disconnected Red Hat OpenShift environment

You can install the {ProductShortName} Operator in a disconnected environment by following the instructions in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.15/html/installing/disconnected-installation-mirroring#installing-mirroring-disconnected[generic procedure].

In step 1 of the generic procedure, configure the image set for mirroring as follows:

[source,yaml]

kind: ImageSetConfiguration
apiVersion: mirror.openshift.io/v1alpha2
storageConfig:
  registry:
    imageURL: registry.to.mirror.to
    skipTLS: false

[id="eviction-threshold_{context}"]
=== Eviction threshold

Each node has a certain amount of memory allocated to it. Some of that memory is reserved for system services. The rest of the memory is intended for running pods. If the pods use more than their allocated amount of memory, an out-of-memory event is triggered and the node is terminated with a `OOMKilled` error.

To prevent out-of-memory events and protect nodes, use the `--eviction-hard` setting. This setting specifies the threshold of memory availability below which the node evicts pods. The value of the setting can be absolute or a percentage.

.Example of node memory allocation settings

- Node capacity: `32Gi`

- `--system-reserved` setting: `3Gi`

- `--eviction-hard` setting: `100Mi`

The amount of memory available for running pods on this node is 28.9 GB. This amount is calculated by subtracting the `system-reserved` and `eviction-hard` values from the overall capacity of the node. If the memory usage exceeds this amount, the node starts evicting pods.


[id="mta-7-red-hat-single-sign-on_{context}"]
== Red Hat Single Sign-On

The {ProductShortName} uses link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_single_sign-on/7.6[Red Hat Single Sign-On (RHSSO)] instance for user authentication and authorization.

The {ProductShortName} operator manages the RHSSO instance and configures a dedicated link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_single_sign-on/7.6/html/server_administration_guide/configuring_realms[realm] with necessary roles and permissions.

{ProductShortName}-managed RHSSO instance allows you to perform advanced RHSSO configurations, such as link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_single_sign-on/7.6/html/server_administration_guide/user-storage-federation#adding_a_provider[adding a provider for User Federation] or link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_single_sign-on/7.6/html/server_administration_guide/identity_broker[integrating identity providers]. To access the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_single_sign-on/7.6/html/server_administration_guide/configuring_realms#using_the_admin_console[RHSSO Admin Console], enter the URL https://<_route_>/auth/admin in your browser by replacing <route> with the {ProductShortName} web console address.

Example:

* MTA web console: https://mta-openshiftmta.example.com/
* RHSSO Admin console: https://mta-openshiftmta.example.com/auth/admin

The admin credentials for RHSSO are stored in a secret file named `credential-mta-rhsso` in the namespace where {ProductShortName} is installed.

To retrieve your admin credentials, run the following command:
----
oc get secret credential-mta-rhsso -o yaml
----

To create a dedicated route for the RHSSO instance, set the `rhsso_external_access` parameter to `true` in the Tackle custom resource (CR) for {ProductShortName}.

[id="mta-roles-personas-users-permissions_{context}"]
=== Roles, Personas, Users, and Permissions

{ProductShortName} makes use of three roles, each of which corresponds to a persona:

.Roles and personas
[cols="50%,50%", options="header"]
|====
|Role
|Persona

|`tackle-admin`
|Administrator

|`tackle-architect`
|Architect

|`tackle-migrator`
|Migrator
|====

The roles are already defined in your RHSSO instance. You do not need to create them.

If you are an {ProductShortName} administrator, you can create users in your RHSSO and assign each user one or more roles, one role per persona.

[id="mta-roles-personas-ui-views_{context}"]
==== Roles, personas, and access to {WebName} views

Although a user can have more than one role, each role corresponds to a specific persona:

* Administrator: An administrator has all the permissions that architects and migrators have, along with the ability to create some application-wide configuration parameters that other users can consume but cannot change or view. Examples: Git credentials, Maven `settings.xml` files.

* Architect: A technical lead for the migration project who can run assessments and can create and modify applications and information related to them. An architect cannot modify or delete sensitive information, but can consume it. Example: Associate an existing credential to the repository of a specific application.

* Migrator: A user who can analyze applications, but not create, modify, or delete them.

As described in xref:mta-ui-interface-views[User interface views], {ProductShortName} has two views, *Administration* and *Migration*.

Only administrators can access *Administration* view. Architects and migrators have no access to *Administration* view, they cannot even see it.

Administrators can perform all actions supported by *Migration* view. Architects and migrators can see all elements of *Migration* view, but their ability to perform actions in *Migration* view depends on the permissions granted to their role.

The ability of administrators, architects, and migrators to access the *Administration* and *Migration* views of the {ProductShortName} {WebName} is summarized in the table below:

.Roles vs. access to {ProductShortName} views
