= How to contribute to the {ProductShortName} project

[role="_abstract"]
You can help the {ProductName} to cover most application builds and server configurations, including yours.

You can help with any of the following items:

* Send an email to jboss-migration-feedback@redhat.com and let us know what {ProductShortName} migration rules must cover.
* Provide example applications to test migration rules.
* Identify application components and problem areas that might be difficult to migrate:
** Write a short description of the problem migration areas.
** Write a brief overview describing how to solve the problem in migration areas.
* Try {ProductName} on your application. Report any issues you meet. {ProductShortName} uses Jira as its issue tracking system. If you encounter an issue when using {ProductShortName}, submit a link:{JiraWindupURL}[Jira issue].
* Contribute to the {ProductName} rules repository:
** Write a {ProductName} rule to identify or automate a migration process.
** Create a test for the new rule.

For more information, see link:{ProductDocRulesGuideURL}[_{RulesDevBookName}_].
* Contribute to the project source code:
