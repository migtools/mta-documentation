The following are the options that you can use together with the `mta-cli analyze` command to adjust the command behavior to your needs.

.`mta-cli analyze` command options
[options="header"]
|====
|Option|Description
|`--analyze-known-libraries` (bool)|Analyze open-source libraries.
|`--disable-maven-search`| Set `--disable-maven-search=true` to disable {ProductShortName} from relying on the Maven search index to determine if a dependency is publicly available (such as an open-source dependency) or internal to the Java binary application during analysis. 
 
When you disable Maven search, {ProductShortName} at first tries to determine dependencies from the the JAR file's POM file (if any). If this method does not succeed, {ProductShortName} goes through the directory structure to determine dependencies. This method may not produce a reliable dependency classification since the package structure can differ from what is expected by {ProductShortName}. You may see more number of incidents because some dependencies may be wrongly classified as internal.

By default, `--disable-maven-search=false`. Therefore, {ProductShortName} uses the SHA digest of the JAR file to search the Maven search index. This setting generates more accurate dependencies but the drawback is that the Maven search index is frequently unavailable.
|`--context-lines` (int)|The number of lines of source code to include in the output for each incident. The default is 100.
|`--dependency-folders` (stringArray)|A directory for dependencies.
|`--enable-default-rulesets` (bool)|Run default rulesets with analysis. The default is `true`.
|`--help`|Display the available flags for the `analyze` command.
|`--http-proxy` (string)|An HTTP proxy string URL.
|`--https-proxy` (string)|An HTTPS proxy string URL.
|`--incident-selector` (string) a|An expression to select incidents based on custom variables, for example:

----
!package=io.demo.config-utils
----
|`--input` (string)|A path to the application source code or a binary.
|`--jaeger-endpoint` (string)|A Jaeger endpoint to collect traces.
|`--json-output` (string)|Create analysis and dependence output as a JSON file.
|`--label-selector` (string)|Run rules based on specified label selector expression.
| `--list-languages` |List all languages in the source application. This flag is not supported for binary applications.
| `--list-providers` |List available supported providers.
|`--list-sources`|List rules for available migration sources.
|`--list-targets`|List rules for available migration targets.
|`--maven-settings` (string)|A path to the custom Maven settings file to use.
|`--mode` (string) a|An analysis mode. Must be set to either of the following values:

* `full` (default)
* `source-only`
|`--no-proxy` (string)|Proxy-excluded URLs (relevant only with proxy).
|`--output` (string)|A path to the directory for analysis output.
|`--overwrite` (bool)|Overwrite the output directory.
|`--rules` (stringArray)|A filename or directory that contains rule files.
|`--run-local`|Enable or disable container runtime usage for Java applications. For example, to enable container runtime, set `--run-local` to `false`. The analysis of non-Java applications runs in container mode by default.
|`--skip-static-report` (bool)|Do not generate the static report.
|`--source` (string) a|A source technology to consider for the analysis.
To specify multiple sources, repeat the parameter, for example:

----
--source <source_1> --source <source_2> ...
----
|`--target` (string) a|A target technology to consider for the analysis.
To specify multiple targets, repeat the parameter, for example:

----
--target <target_1> --target <target_2> ...
----
|`--log-level uint32`|A log level. The default is 4.
|`--no-cleanup` (bool)|Do not clean up temporary resources.
