= Installing the CLI on a disconnected environment

[role="_abstract"]
In certain cases, you might want to install the {ProductFullName} command-line interface (CLI) when no internet connection is available.

When your system is in a disconnected environment, you can install the {ProductFullName} command-line interface (CLI) by performing the following actions:

. Download the required images by using an external computer.
. Copying the downloaded images to the system you want to install {ProductShortName} CLI on.

IMPORTANT: The following procedure applies only to container mode.

NOTE: The analysis output in the disconnected environment usually results in fewer incidents because a dependency analysis does not run accurately without access to Maven.

.Prerequisites

* You downloaded the required {ProductShortName} CLI binary from the link:https://developers.redhat.com/products/mta/download[{ProductName} Red Hat Developer page].
* You installed the Podman tool on your system.
* For the analysis of Java applications, you enabled container runtime usage by setting the `--run-local` flag to `false`: 
+
....
--run-local=false
....
+
The analysis of non-Java applications runs in container mode by default.


.Procedure

. On a connected device, perform the following steps:

.. Authenticate to registry.redhat.io:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
....
$ *podman login registry.redhat.io*
....

.. Run the `mta-cli` binary file. The binary file pulls the required provider images. For example:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
....
$ *mta-cli analyze*
....
+
IMPORTANT: This command only pulls the required images. For example, if you run a command that requires Java images, a .NET image will not be pulled.

.. Display the image list:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
....
$ *podman images*

....

.. Save the images:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
....
$ *podman save _<image_ID>_ -o _<image_name>_.image*
....

.. Copy the images onto a USB drive or directly to the file system of the disconnected device. 

. On the disconnected device, enter:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
....
$ *podman load --input _<image_name>_.image*
....
