= Persistent volume requirements

[role="_abstract"]
To successfully deploy, the {ProductShortName} Operator requires two ReadWriteOnce (RWO) persistent volumes (PVs) used by different components. If the `rwx_supported` configuration option is set to `true`, the {ProductShortName} Operator requires additional two ReadWriteMany (RWX) PVs that are used by Maven and the hub file storage.
