Multiple assessment questionnaires::
The *Assessment* module supports multiple questionnaires, relevant to one or more applications.

You can group applications with similar characteristics into archetypes. This allows you to assess multiple applications at once. Each archetype has a shared taxonomy of tags, stakeholders, and stakeholder groups. All applications inherit assessment and review from their assigned archetypes.
