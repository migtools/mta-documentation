= Configuring and running an application analysis

You can analyze more than one application at a time against more than one transformation target in the same analysis.

IMPORTANT: If you analyze an application that requires Maven credentials to access private repositories, you must assign these credentials in the Credentials section of the Administration view. Otherwise, there might be an impact on the quality of the analysis, identified issues, or the {ProductShortName} performance. For more information, see xref:configuring-credentials_configuring-mta-instance-environment[Configuring credentials].


[IMPORTANT]
====
When your system is in a disconnected environment, but you have access to a Maven proxy, the application analysis runs without failure. However, if you do not have access to the Maven proxy, Maven cannot build the application because it cannot access the required dependencies.	

Note also that the analysis output in the disconnected environment usually results in less incidents because a dependency analysis does not run accurately without access to Maven.

.Procedure

. In the *Migration* view, click *Application inventory*.
. Select an application that you want to analyze.
+
// ![](/Tackle2/AppAssessAnalyze/SelectManageCred.png)

. Review the credentials assigned to the application.
. Click *Analyze*.
+
// ![](/Tackle2/AppAssessAnalyze/AnalysisMode.png)

. Select the *Analysis mode* from the list:
* Binary
* Source code
* Source code and dependencies
* Upload a local binary. This option only appears if you are analyzing a single application. If you chose this option, you are prompted to *Upload a local binary*. Either drag a file into the area provided or click *Upload* and select the file to upload.
. Click *Next*.
. Select one or more target options for the analysis:

* Application server migration to either of the following platforms:
** JBoss EAP 7
** JBoss EAP 8
* Containerization
* Quarkus
* OracleJDK to OpenJDK
* OpenJDK. Use this option to upgrade to either of the following JDK versions:
** OpenJDK 11
** OpenJDK 17
** OpenJDK 21
* Linux. Use this option to ensure that there are no Microsoft Windows paths hard-coded into your applications.
* Jakarta EE 9. Use this option to migrate from Java EE 8.
* Spring Boot on Red Hat Runtimes
* Open Liberty
* Camel. Use this option to migrate from Apache Camel 2 to Apache Camel 3 or from Apache Camel 3 to Apache Camel 4.
* Azure App Service
. Click *Next*.
. Select one of the following *Scope* options to better focus the analysis:

* Application and internal dependencies only.
* Application and all dependencies, including known Open Source libraries.
* Select the list of packages to be analyzed manually. If you choose this option, type the file name and click *Add*.
* Exclude packages. If you choose this option, type the name of the package and click *Add*.

. Click *Next*.
. In *Advanced*, you can attach additional custom rules to the analysis by selecting the *Manual* or *Repository* mode:
** In the *Manual* mode, click *Add Rules*. Drag the relevant files or select the files from their directory and click *Add*.
** In the *Repository* mode, you can add rule files from a Git or Subversion repository.
+
IMPORTANT: Attaching custom rules is optional if you have already attached a migration target to the analysis. If you have not attached any migration target, you must attach rules.

. Optional: Set any of the following options:
* Target
* Source(s)
* Excluded rules tags. Rules with these tags are not processed. Add or delete as needed.
* Enable automated tagging. Select the checkbox to automatically attach tags to the application. This checkbox is selected by default.
+
NOTE: Automatically attached tags are displayed only _after_ you run the analysis. You can attach tags to the application manually instead of enabling automated tagging or in addition to it.
+
NOTE: Analysis engines use standard rules for a comprehensive set of migration targets. However, if the target is not included, is a customized framework, or the application is written in a language that is not supported, for example, Ruby, you can add custom rules by skipping the target selection in the Set Target tab and uploading custom rule files in the Custom Rules tab. Only custom rule files that are uploaded manually are validated.

. Click *Next*.
. In *Review*, verify the analysis parameters.
. Click *Run*.
+
The analysis status is `Scheduled` as {ProductShortName} downloads the image for the container to execute. When the image is downloaded, the status changes to `In-progress.`
+
NOTE: Analysis takes minutes to hours to run depending on the size of the application and the capacity and resources of the cluster.
+
NOTE: {ProductShortName} relies on Kubernetes scheduling capabilities to determine how many analyzer instances are created based on cluster capacity. If several applications are selected for analysis, by default, only one analyzer can be provisioned at a time. With more cluster capacity, more analysis processes can be executed in parallel.

. Optional: To track the status of your active analysis task, open the *Task Manager* drawer by clicking the notifications button.
+
Alternatively, hover over the application name to display the pop-over window.
. When analysis is complete, to see its results, open the application drawer by clicking on the application name.

NOTE: After creating an application instance on the Application Inventory page, the language discovery task starts, automatically pre-selecting the target filter option. However, you can choose a different language that you prefer.
