= Configuring Maven credentials

To access private Maven repositories, you can configure new Maven credentials by using the `settings.xml` settings file. 

.Procedure

. In *Administration* view, click *Credentials*.
. Click *Create new*.
// ![](/Tackle2/Views/NewCredMaven.png)
. Enter the following information:
* Name
* Description (Optional)
. In the *Type* list, select *Maven Settings File.*
. Upload the `settings.xml` settings file or paste its contents.
. Optional: If you want to set Maven credentials as default, enable the *Use as the source control credential if an application does not have any assigned?* switch. These credentials will be used by default for all applications that do not have any assigned credentials.
+
IMPORTANT: If you do not set Maven credentials as default, you must assign these credentials to the application manually before running an analysis. Otherwise, credentials will not be picked up by the application, which might result in the analysis running longer.

. Click *Create*.
+
NOTE: {ProductShortName} validates the input and creates a new credential. The Maven `settings.xml` file must be parsed and checked for validity. If the validation fails, the following error message is displayed: `“not a valid key/XML file”`.
