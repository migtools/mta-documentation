= Configuring source control credentials

To access private repositories when analyzing an application or creating a custom migration target that pulls the rules from a private repository, you can configure source control credentials. These credentials include the username and password or Supply Chain Management (SCM) private key and a passphrase.

.Procedure

. In *Administration* view, click *Credentials*.
. Click *Create new*.

. Enter the following information:
* Name
* Description (Optional)
. In the *Type* list, select *Source Control*.
. In the *User credentials* list, select *Credential Type* and enter the requested information:

* Username/Password
    ** Username
    ** Password (hidden)
* SCM Private Key/Passphrase
    ** SCM Private Key
    ** Private Key Passphrase (hidden)
+
NOTE: Type-specific credential information such as keys and passphrases is either hidden or shown as [Encrypted].

NOTE: {ProductShortName} validates the input and creates a new credential. SCM keys must be parsed and checked for validity. If the validation fails, the following error message is displayed: `“not a valid key/XML file”`.
