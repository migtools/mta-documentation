= Controlling the order of task execution

You can use *Task Manager* to preempt a {ProductFullName} task you have scheduled for execution. 

[NOTE]
====
You can enable *Preemption* on any scheduled task (not in the status of *Running*, *Succeeded*, or *Failed*). However, only lower-priority tasks are candidates to be preempted. When a higher-priority task is blocked by lower-priority tasks and has *Preemption* enabled, the low-priority tasks might be rescheduled so that the blocked higher-priority task might run. Therefore, it is only useful to enable *Preemption* on higher-priority tasks, for example, application analysis.
====

.Procedure

. In the *Migration* view, click *Task Manager*.
. Click the *Options* menu ({kebab}) for the selected task.
. Depending on your scenario, complete one of the following steps:

** To enable *Preemption* for the task, select *Enable preemption*. 
** To disable *Preemption* for the task with enabled *Preemption*, select *Disable preemption*.
