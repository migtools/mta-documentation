= Creating a Jira connection

To track  your application migrations, you can define a Jira instance in {ProductShortName} and establish a connection to that instance.

IMPORTANT: You cannot remove a Jira connection that you used for creating issues for a migration wave as long as the issues exist in Jira, even after the migration wave is deleted.

.Prerequisites

* You created {ProductShortName} credentials. For more information, see xref:configuring-jira-credentials_creating-and-configuring-a-jira-connection[Configuring Jira credentials]. 

.Procedure

. In *Administration* view, under *Issue Management*, click *Jira*.
. Click *Create new*.
. In the *New instance* window, enter the following information:
* Name of the instance
* URL of the web interface of your Jira account
* Select either the *Jira Cloud* or *Jira Server/Data center* instance type from the list
* Select credentials from the list
+
[NOTE]
====
If you selected *Jira Cloud* as an instance type, only *Basic Auth* credentials are displayed in the list.

If you selected *Jira Server/Data center* as an instance type, both *Basic Auth* and *Token Bearer* credentials are displayed. 

Choose the type that is appropriate for the particular configuration of your Jira server or data center.
====
+
. By default, a connection cannot be established with a server with an invalid certificate. To override this restriction, enable the *Enable insecure communication* switch.
. Click *Create*.
+
The new connection instance appears on the *Jira configuration* page.

.Verification

* On the *Jira configuration* page, ensure that the connection has been established and authorized:

** If the status of the *Connection* column displays *Connected*, the Jira connection is established and authorized.					
** If the status of the *Connection* column displays *Not connected*, click the status to check the reason for the error.
