= Creating a stakeholder

[role="_abstract"]
To identify the individuals responsible for specific applications, define stakeholders in the {ProductFullName} user interface (UI). Defining these roles ensures that migration assessments and questionnaires are directed to the correct subject matter experts for each application.

You can create and configure stakeholders in any order. However, the following is the most efficient order: 						

. Create Stakeholder groups. Note that by default, no stakeholder groups are defined.
. Create Job functions.	The job function attribute classifies stakeholders and provides a list of default values that can be expanded. 							
. Create Stakeholders.
