= Creating Jira issues for a migration wave

You can use a migration wave to create Jira issues automatically for each application assigned to the migration wave. A separate Jira issue is created for each application associated with the migration wave. The following fields of each issue are filled in automatically:

* Title: `Migrate <application name>`
* Reporter: Username of the token owner.
* Description: `Created by Konveyor`

NOTE: You cannot delete an application if it is linked to a Jira ticket or is associated with a migration wave. To unlink the application from the Jira ticket, click the `Unlink from Jira` icon in the details view of the application or in the details view of a migration wave.

.Prerequisites

* You configured Jira connection. For more information, see xref:creating-and-configuring-a-jira-connection_user-interface-guide[Creating and configuring a Jira connection].


.Procedure

. In the *Migration* view, click *Migration waves*.
. Click the Options menu ({kebab}) to the right of the migration wave for which you want to create Jira issues and select *Export to Issue Manager*. The *Export to Issue Manager* window opens.
. Select the Jira Cloud or Jira Server/Datacenter instance type.
. Select the instance, project, and issue type from the lists.
. Click *Export*. The status of the migration wave on the *Migration waves* page changes to `Issues Created`.
. Optional: To see the status of each individual application of a migration wave, click the *Status* column.
. Optional: To see if any particular application is associated with a migration wave, open the application's *Details* tab on the *Application inventory* page.

[NOTE]
====
After you exported a migration wave to the Issue Manager and the Jira issues are created, you can no longer change them from within the {ProductShortName} {WebName}. Even if you delete the migration wave, the Jira issues remain.
