= Downloading an analysis report

An {ProductShortName} analysis report contains a number of sections, including a listing of the technologies used by the application, the dependencies of the application, and the lines of code that must be changed to successfully migrate or modernize the application.

For more information about the contents of an {ProductShortName} analysis report, see link:{ProductDocUserGuideURL}#reviewing-analysis-reports_cli-guide[Reviewing the reports].

For your convenience, you can download analysis reports. Note that by default this option is disabled.

.Procedure

. In *Administration* view, click *General*.
. Toggle the *Allow reports to be downloaded after running an analysis.*  switch.
. Go to the *Migration* view and click *Application inventory*.
. Click on the application row to open the application drawer. 
. Click the *Reports* tab.
. Click either the *HTML* or *YAML* link:
* By clicking the *HTML* link, you download the compressed `analysis-report-app-<application_name>.tar` file. Extracting this file creates a folder with the same name as the application.
