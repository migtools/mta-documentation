= Generating discovery manifests

[role="_abstract"] 
To validate your application inventory before performing a full analysis, generate a discovery manifest in the {ProductFullName} user interface (UI).

To generate discovery manifest, you must retrieve the application configuration from the Cloud Foundry (CF) source platform instance. {ProductShortName} generates a discovery manifest that has the application configuration, which you can later use to generate assets (deployment manifests).

You can retrieve configuration for one or more applications at a time.

.Prerequisites
* The Cloud Foundry instance from which you want to retrieve configuration is running.

* You configured a source platform for the applications for which you need to retrieve configurations.

.Procedure

. In the {ProductShortName} user interface, select the *Migration* working view.

. On the *Application Inventory* page, you can retrieve configuration for one or more applications:

* Retrieve configuration for a single application:
... Select an application and click the Options menu ({kebab}).
... Click *Retrieve Configurations*.

* Retrieve configurations for multiple applications:
... Select the target applications or click the Select all option (image:select.png[]).
... Click the Options menu near *Analyze* at the top and click *Retrieve Configurations*.
+
. You can review the read-only configurations in the *Retrieve Configurations* dialog and click *Retrieve*.
{ProductShortName} triggers a task to retrieve configuration for each application.

.Verification

. Click an application row to open the application details view and click the *Platform* tab.

. Review the discovery manifest with the retrieved configuration and download the JSON configuration, if necessary.
