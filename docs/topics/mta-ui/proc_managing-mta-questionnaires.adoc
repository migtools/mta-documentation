= Managing assessment questionnaires

[role="_abstract"] 
To adjust the scope of your assessments, manage questionnaires in the {ProductFullName} user interface (UI). By importing, viewing, or deleting questionnaires, you control the criteria the {ProductShortName} UI uses to evaluate the suitability of your applications for modernization.

By using the {ProductShortName} UI, you can perform the following actions on assessment questionnaires:

* Display the questionnaire. You can also display the answer choices and their associated risk weight.
* Export the questionnaire to the desired location on your system. 
* Import the questionnaire from your system. 
+
WARNING: The name of the imported questionnaire must be unique.
If the name, which is defined in the YAML syntax (`name:<name of questionnaire>`), is duplicated, the import will fail with the following error message: `UNIQUE constraint failed: Questionnaire.Name`.
* Delete an assessment questionnaire.
+
WARNING: When you delete the questionnaire, its answers for all applications that use it in all archetypes are also deleted.
