= The custom questionnaire fields

Every custom questionnaire field marked as *required* is mandatory and must be completed. Otherwise, the YAML syntax will not validate on upload. Each subsection of the field defines a new structure or object in YAML, for example:

[source,yaml]
----
...
name: Testing
thresholds:
    red: 30
    yellow: 45
    unknown: 5
...

.The custom questionnaire fields
[options="header"]
|====
|Questionnaire field|Description
|`name` (required, string) |The name of the questionnaire. This field must be unique for the entire {ProductShortName} instance.
|`description` (optional, string)|A short description of the questionnaire.
|`thresholds` (required) a|The definition of a threshold for each risk category of the application or archetype that is considered to be affected by that risk level. The threshold values can be the following:

* `red` (required, unsigned integer): Numeric percentage, for example, `30` for `30%`, of red answers that the questionnaire can have until the risk level is considered red.
* `yellow` (required, unsigned integer): Numeric percentage, for example, `30` for `30%`, of yellow answers that the questionnaire can have until the risk level is considered yellow.
* `unknown` (required, unsigned integer): Numeric percentage, for example, `30` for `30%`, of unknown answers that the questionnaire can have until the risk level is considered
unknown.

The higher risk level always takes precedence. For example, if the `yellow` threshold is set to 30% and `red` to 5%, and the answers for the application or archetype are set to have 35% `yellow` and 6% `red`, the risk level for the application or archetype is red.

|`riskMessages` (required) a| Messages to be displayed in reports for each risk category. The _risk_messages_ map is defined by the following fields:

* `red` (required, string): A message to be displayed in reports for the red risk level.
* `yellow` (required, string): A message to be displayed in reports for the yellow risk level.
* `green` (required, string): A message to be displayed in reports for the green risk level.
* `unknown` (required, string): A message to be displayed in reports for the unknown risk level.
