.The default `values.yaml` file is merged with the discover `values.yaml` file when generating a deployment manifest

Before this update, when you generated a deployment manifest by using the Helm template, the default values in the`values.yaml` file, packaged with the Helm chart, were ignored. Consequently, only the values from the `values.yaml` file created after running the `mta-cli discover` command were used. With this update, the default `values.yaml` file is merged with the discover `values.yaml` file.
