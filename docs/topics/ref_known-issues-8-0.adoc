= Known issues

{ProductFullName} version 8.0.0 is affected by the following newly identified and previously known issues. A known issue is listed in all future release notes until resolved, at which point it is published as a fixed issue.


.Application analysis with {ProductShortName} CLI might fail with the "invalid header line" error

An application analysis by using the {ProductFullName} command-line interface (CLI) might fail with the following error message:

----
level=error msg="initialize failed" error="context canceled" provider=java
error="invalid header line "An error has occurred. See the log file"
----

To work around this problem, clean up metadata and cache:

. Clear the `.metadata` subdirectory under the directory from which you ran the `mta-cli analyze` command.
. Clear the Maven cache.

.{ProductShortName} analysis result does not change if you add or remove a custom rule 

When you use Developer Lightspeed for {ProductShortName}, the analysis results do not change if you include or remove a custom rule but do not restart the analyzer process. 

To work around this problem, restart the analyzer process by clicking the Start/Stop button after making a configuration change.

.`ANNOTATION` location rules do not match on FQNs

The `ANNOTATION` search location does not properly use Fully Qualified Names (FQNs) to match annotations. This leads to incorrect matches and false positives in analysis issues. For example, a rule that searches for annotations using the `javax.enterprise.inject.Produces` pattern might incorrectly match the occurrences of the `javax.ws.rs.Produces` annotation in the source code.

No known workaround exists.

.Developer Lightspeed for {ProductShortName} database throws a connection error

The Solution Server throws a connection error when concurrent connections increase in a short span of time.
To work around this problem, enter the following command to allow the Developer Lightspeed for {ProductShortName} database to expire idle connections:

[source,terminal]
----
oc -n openshift-mta exec deploy/kai-db â€“ psql -U postgres -d postgres -c "ALTER ROLE kai SET idle_session_timeout = '1min'; ALTER ROLE kai SET idle_in_transaction_session_timeout = '1min';" 
----
