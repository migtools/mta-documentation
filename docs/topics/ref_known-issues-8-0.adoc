{ProductFullName} version {ProductVersion} is affected by the following newly identified and previously known issues. A known issue is listed in all future release notes until resolved, at which point it is published as a fixed issue.


.An analysis might fail after MTA CLI is upgraded without a cleanup

An application analysis by using the {ProductFullName} command-line interface (CLI) might fail after you perform the following actions:

. Run the analysis on the current {ProductShortName} CLI version.
. Upgrade to and deploy the newer {ProductShortName} CLI version.
. Run the analysis on the newly deployed {ProductShortName} CLI version.

To work around this problem, clean up metadata and cache:

. Clear the `.metadata` subdirectory under the directory from which you ran the `mta-cli analyze` command. 
. Clear the Maven cache.
