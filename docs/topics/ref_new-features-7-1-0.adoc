= New features

This section provides the new features and improvements of the {ProductFullName} 7.1.0.

.A support for analyzing applications managed with Gradle has been added to {ProductShortName} 

Previously, you could use the {ProductFullName} to analyze Java applications managed only with Maven. With this update, {ProductShortName} can also extract dependencies from Gradle projects. As a result, you can now analyze applications that use Gradle instead of Maven. 

.Assessment and review statuses are now displayed during the archetype assessment and review

With this update, the status of the archetype assessment and review processes is displayed in the {ProductFullName} user interface (UI):

* The assessment statuses are the following:
** Completed: All required assessments completed.
** InProgress: The assessment process is in progress.
** NotStarted: The assessment process has not been started.
* The review statuses are the following:
** Completed: A review exists.
** NotStarted: The review process has not been started.
