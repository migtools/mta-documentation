= Fixed issues

[role="_abstract"]
{ProductFullName} version 8.0.1 provides the following fixed issues and other problems that have a significant impact. 

.You can import Cloud Foundry applications from the application inventory in the {ProductShortName} web console 

Before this update, an {ProductShortName} Architect could not discover or import applications from a source platform on the application inventory page. As a result, only an {ProductShortName} Administrator could import the applications from the Source Platform page in the Administrator mode. With this release, this issue is fixed. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-6120([MTA-6120])

.Cloud Foundry applications imported in {ProductShortName} are tagged automatically

When you imported applications in {ProductShortName} from a Cloud Foundry (CF) instance, the applications did not contain the `Cloud Foundry` tag. The tag links an application to an archetype. The archetype has a generator that produces the deployment assets for a migration path. With this release, this issue is fixed. You no longer have to add the tags to link a CF application to the archetype. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-6282([MTA-6282])

.{ProductShortName} enables you to target an organization when importing applications from Cloud Foundry

When you imported applcations from Cloud Foundry (CF), {ProductShortName} did not have a provision for you to mention a target organization. With this release, this issue is fixed. You can configure one or more organizations, spaces, and applications for the discovery process. The spaces can belong to different organizations and the applications can belong to different spaces. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-6271([MTA-6271])

.{ProductShortName} displays source repository URL when you skip configuring the repository type field

{ProductShortName} did not show the source repository URL in the application details view if you did not select between the `Git` or `Subversion` repository type. As a result, you could not run an analysis on the application source code. With this release, this issue is fixed. You can now use {ProductShortName} to run an analysis on the source code even if you do not configure the repository type field. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-6105([MTA-6105])


.{ProductShortName} triggers rules to match import statements with wildcard in Java applications analysis

{ProductShortName} did not trigger rule to match import statements that contain a wildcard when analyzing a Java application. Consequently, specific incidents were not detected in the report after the analysis. With this release, this issue is fixed. 
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-4027([MTA-4027])

.Concurrent usage of {mta-dl-plugin} for code resolution at scale no longer causes race conditions

Concurrent usage of the Solution Server through the {mta-dl-plugin} Visual Studio (VS) Code plugin for code resolution at scale caused race conditions for duplicate incidents. With this release, this issue is fixed. The plugin generates resolutions for the incidents identified when many users use it concurrently.

.{ProductShortName} no longer fails language and tech discovery for Java application in SVN repositories

Before this update, for a Java application source code stored in an SVN repository, {ProductShortName} produced an error when trying to checkout the repository by using the SVN credential. As a result, the language and tech discovery of the application failed. With this release, this issue is fixed. You can now analyze an application stored in SVN repository without any error.link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-6141([MTA-6141])

.{ProductShortName} rules for Java use FQN to match annotations in source code 

Before this update, the annotation rules for Java applications did not use Fully Qualified Names (FQNs) to match with the annotation location in rules. As a result, the rule triggered incorrect matches or false positives for issues. For example, a rule that looked for the `javax.enterprise.inject.Produces` incorrectly matched with occurrences of `javax.ws.rs.Produces`. With this release, this issue is fixed. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-6195([MTA-6195])

.{ProductShortName} flags open source dependencies in Gradle application 

{ProductShortName} did not trigger a violation for open source libraries in a `source+dependency` analysis of a Gradle application. With this release, this issue is fixed. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-6211([MTA-6211])
//Appears to be a fixed issue in 8.0.0. Should this be documented in 8.0.1? MTA-4033

.{ProductShortName} web console detects custom rules when many are uploaded at a time

When you uploaded more than one custom rule at a time in the {ProductShortName} web console, the rules were not detected. With this version, this issue is fixed. You can upload multiple custom rules at once. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-6029([MTA-6029])
