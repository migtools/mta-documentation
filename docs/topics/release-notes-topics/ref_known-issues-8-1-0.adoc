//To be confirmed by SME (the comment is in the ticket)

////
{ProductShortName} UI does not trigger rules for dependencies for Gradle applications::
When you run a `source+dependency` analysis for a Gradle application by using the {ProductFullName} user interface (UI), the tool does not trigger rules for dependencies. As a consequence, the analysis does not trigger issues on open source libraries 

Note that this known issue does not affect the {ProductShortName} command-line interface (CLI).
