= Annotation inspection

You can add a query to match against specific annotations and their elements, for example:

[source,yaml]
----
when:
  java.referenced:
    location: METHOD
    pattern: org.package.MyApplication.runApplication(java.lang.String)
    annotated:
      pattern: org.framework.Bean
      elements:
      - name: url
        value: "http://www.example.com"
----

This would match against the `runApplication` method in the following Java code:

[source,java]
----
package org.package

import org.framework.Bean;

class MyApplication {

    @Bean(url = "http://www.example.com")
    public String runApplication(String str) {
        // ...
    }
}
----

The structure of the `annotated` YAML element is:

[source,yaml]
----
annotated:
  pattern: a Java regex to match the fully qualified name of the annotation (optional)
  elements: an array of elements to match within the annotation (optional)
  - name: the exact name of the element to match against
    value: a Java regex to match the value of the element
----

It is also possible to match an annotation with specific elements, without having to specify the symbol it annotates. The following example would also match on the `@Bean` annotation in the same code as the previous example:

[source,yaml]
----
when:
  java.referenced:
    location: ANNOTATION
    pattern: org.framework.Bean
    annotated:
      elements:
        - name: url
          value: "http://www.example.com"
----
[NOTE]
====
The only element specified with a `pattern` is the annotation itself.
