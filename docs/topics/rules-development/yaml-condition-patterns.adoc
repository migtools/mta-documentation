= Condition patterns

The Language Server used by the Java provider is Eclipseâ€™s JDTLS. Internally, the JDTLS uses the Eclipse Java Development Toolkit, which includes utilities for searching code in projects.

In the `pattern` element of a `java.referenced` condition, you can search through application code by using these utilities. For more details, see link:https://help.eclipse.org/latest/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fapi%2Forg%2Feclipse%2Fjdt%2Fcore%2Fsearch%2FSearchPattern.html&anchor=createPattern[Class SearchPattern], which  contains all the information for building these patterns for `createPattern(String, int, int, int)`.

.Examples

* Search for any class under the `javax.xml` package, occurring in any
location:
+
[source,yaml]
----
java.referenced:
  pattern: javax.xml*
----
+
[WARNING]
====
When matching against packages, as in the previous example, the asterisk must not be after a dot. For example:
* `pattern: javax.xml*`
and not:
* `pattern: javax.xml.*`

====

* Search for method declarations that return `java.lang.String`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
java.referenced:
  location: METHOD
  pattern: '* java.lang.String'
----

* Search for a method named "`method`" declared on `org.konveyor.MyClass`
that returns a `List` of a type that extends `java.lang.String`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
java.referenced:
  location: METHOD
  pattern: 'org.konveyor.Myclass.method(*) java.util.List<? extends java.lang.String>'
----

* Search for a class that implements `java.util.List`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
java.referenced:
  location: IMPLEMENTS_TYPE
  pattern: java.util.List
----
