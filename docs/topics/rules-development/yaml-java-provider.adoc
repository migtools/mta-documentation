= Java provider

The `java` provider analyzes Java source code.

This provider has the following capabilities:

* `referenced`
* `dependency`

.`referenced`

By using the `referenced` capability, the provider finds references in the source code. This capability takes three input parameters: `pattern`, `location`, and `annotated`.

when:
  java.referenced:
    pattern: "<pattern>" # <1>
    location: "<location>" # <2>
    annotated: "<annotated>" # <3>
----
<1> A regular expression pattern to match.
<2> Specifies the exact location where the pattern needs to be matched, for example, `IMPORT`.
<3> Checks for specific annotations and their elements, such as name and value, in the Java code using a query. For example, the following query matches the `Bean` (url = “http://www.example.com”) annotation in the method.
