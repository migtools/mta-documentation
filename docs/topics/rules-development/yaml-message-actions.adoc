= Message action

A message action is employed to generate an issue with the specified message when a rule matches, for example:

[source,yaml]
----
# When a match is found, the analyzer generates incidents with the same message.
message: "helpful message about the violation"
----

You can also create a template message to include information about the match that has been interpolated through custom variables on the rule.
// link link:#custom-variables[Custom Variables]):

[source,yaml]
----
- ruleID: lang-ref-004
   customVariables:
   - pattern: '([A-z]+)\.get\(\)'
      name: VariableName
    message: "Found generic call - {{ VariableName }}"
  when:
    <CONDITION>
