= Message action

[role="_abstract"]
A message action is used to generate an issue with the specified message when a rule condition matches the source code, for example:

[source,yaml]
----
- ruleID: test-rule
  message: Test rule matched. Please resolve this migration issue.
  when:
    <CONDITION>
----

Optionally, a message can include hyperlinks to external URLs that provide relevant information about the issue or a quick fix.

[source,yaml]
----
links:
  - url: "konveyor.io"
    title: "Short title for the link"
----

You can also create a template message to include information about the match that has been interpolated through xref:yaml-custom-variables_logical-chaining-custom-variables[custom variables] on the rule.
// link link:#custom-variables[Custom Variables]):

[source,yaml]
----
- ruleID: lang-ref-004
   customVariables:
   - pattern: '([A-z]+)\.get\(\)'
      name: VariableName
    message: "Found generic call - {{ VariableName }}"
  when:
    <CONDITION>
----
