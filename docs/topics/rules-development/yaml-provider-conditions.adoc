= Provider condition

The analyzer engine enables multi-language source code analysis by using  *providers*. The source code of a technology is analyzed by the provider.

The provider publishes what they can do with the source code in terms of capabilities.

The provider condition instructs the analyzer to use a specific provider and one of its capabilities. In general, it follows the `<provider_name>.<capability>` pattern.

[source,terminal]
----
when:
  <provider_name>.<capability>
    <input_fields>
----

The analyzer currently supports the following `provider` conditions:

* `builtin`
* `java`
* `go`
* `dotnet`

|Provider rule conditions |Provider name

| Java

| Providers that have rules already defined in the product

|Providers that require custom rulesets for analysis

* Go
* Python
* Node.js

[NOTE]
====
Depending on the provider, the fields of the condition, for example, the pattern and location in the previous example changes.
====

Some providers have *dependency_ capability*. The dependency_capability means that the provider generates a list of dependencies for a given application.

You can use a dependency_condition to query this list and check whether a
certain dependency, with a version range, exists for the application.

For example, to check if a Java application has a certain dependency, you create a `java.dependency` condition:

[source,yaml]
----
when:
  java.dependency:
    name: junit.junit
    upperbound: 4.12.2
    lowerbound: 4.4.0
----

The *Analyzer* currently supports the following providers:

* `builtin`
* `java`
* `go`
* `generic`

The following table summarizes all the providers and their
capabilities:

.Summary of providers and their capabilities
[width="100%",cols="15%,25%,60%",options="header",]
|===
|Provider Name |Capabilities |Description

.2+|`java`
|referenced
|Find references of a pattern with an optional code location for detailed searches.

|dependency
|Check whether the application has a given dependency.

.5+|`builtin`
|xml
|Search XML files using xpath queries.


|`json`
|Search JSON files using `jsonpath` queries.

|filecontent
|Search content in regular files using regular expression patterns.


|file
|Find files with names matching a given pattern.

|hasTags
|Check whether a tag is created for the application using a tagging rule.

.2+|`go`
|referenced
|Find references to a pattern.

|dependency
|Check whether the application has a given dependency.
|===

Following the example in the previous table, you can create the first part of the condition that does not contain any of the condition fields.

.Example

To create a `java` provider condition that uses the `referenced` capability:

[source,yaml]
----
when:
  java.referenced:
    <fields>
----

[NOTE]
====
Depending on the _provider_ and the _capability_, there will be different `<fields>` in the condition.
====

The following table summarizes available providers, their capabilities and all of their fields:

.Example

For example, to complete the previous `java` condition example we created earlier, search for references of a package:

[source,yaml]
----
when:
  java.referenced:
    location: PACKAGE
    pattern: org.jboss*
----
