= Rule actions

Rules can include the following types of actions:

* message
* tag

Each rule includes either one of them or both of them.

[id="message-actions"]
.Message actions

When a message action matches the rule, it creates an issue. The custom data that providers export can be used in the message.


[source,yaml]
----
- ruleID: test-rule
  when:
    <CONDITION>
  message: Test rule matched. Please resolve this migration issue.
----

Optionally, a message can include hyperlinks to external URLs that provide relevant information about the issue or a quick fix.

[source,yaml]
----
links:
  - url: "konveyor.io"
    title: "Short title for the link"
----

A message can also be a template to include information about the match interpolated through custom variables on the rule.
