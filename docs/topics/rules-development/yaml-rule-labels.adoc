= Rule labels

Labels are `key=val` pairs specified for rules or rulesets as well as dependencies. For dependencies, a provider adds the labels to the dependencies when retrieving them. Labels on a ruleset are automatically inherited by all the rules that belong to it.

.Label format

Labels are specified under the `labels` field as a list of strings in `key=val` format as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
labels:
- "key1=val1"
- "key2=val2"
----

The key of a label can be subdomain-prefixed:

[source,yaml]
----
labels:
- "konveyor.io/key1=val1"
----

The value of a label can be empty:

[source,yaml]
----
labels:
- "konveyor.io/key="
----

The value of a label can be omitted. In that case, it is treated as an empty value:

[source,yaml]
----
labels:
- "konveyor.io/key"
----

.Reserved labels

The analyzer defines some labels that have special meaning as follows:

* `konveyor.io/source`: Identifies the source technology to which a rule or a ruleset applies.

* `konveyor.io/target`: Identifies the target technology to which a rule or a ruleset applies.

.Label selector

The analyzer CLI takes the `--label-selector` field as an option. It is a string expression that supports logical AND, OR, and NOT operations. You can use it to filter-in or filter-out rules by their labels.

_Examples:_

* To filter-in all rules that have a label with the key `konveyor.io/source` and value `eap6`:
+
`--label-selector="konveyor.io/source=eap6"`

* To filter-in all rules that have a label with the key `konveyor.io/source` and any value:
+
`--label-selector="konveyor.io/source"`

* To perform logical AND operations on matches of multiple rules by using the `&&` operator:
+
`--label-selector="key1=val1 && key2"`

* To perform logical OR operations on matches of multiple rules by using the `||` operator:
+
`--label-selector="key1=val1 || key2"`

* To perform a NOT operation to filter-out rules that have `key1=val1` label set by using the `!` operator:
+
`--label-selector="!key1=val1"`

* To group sub-expressions and control precedence by using AND:
+
`--label-selector="(key1=val1 || key2=val2) && !val3"`

.Dependency labels

The analyzer engine adds labels to dependencies. These labels provide additional information about a dependency, such as its programming language and whether the dependency is open source or internal.

Currently, the analyzer adds the following labels to dependencies:

[source,yaml]
----
labels:
- konveyor.io/dep-source=internal
- konveyor.io/language=java
----

.Dependency label selector

The analyzer CLI accepts the `--dep-label-selector` option, which allows filtering-in or filtering-out incidents generated from a dependency by their labels.

For example, the analyzer adds a `konveyor.io/dep-source` label to dependencies with a value that indicates whether the dependency is a known open source dependency.

To exclude incidents for all such open source dependencies, you can use `--dep-label-selector` as follows:

`konveyor-analyzer ... --dep-label-selector !konveyor.io/dep-source=open-source`

The Java provider in the analyzer can also add an exclude label to a list of packages. To exclude all such packages, you can use `--dep-label-selector` and the `!` operator as follows:

`konveyor-analyzer ... --dep-label-selector !konveyor.io/exclude`
