= YAML rule structure and syntax

{ProductShortName} analyzer rules use the following rule pattern:

----
when(condition)
 message(message)
 tag(tags)
----

Rules are written in YAML. They consist of:

* metadata
* conditions
* actions

Rules instruct the analyzer to take specified actions when given conditions match.

A YAML rule file in {ProductShortName} contains one or more YAML rules.
