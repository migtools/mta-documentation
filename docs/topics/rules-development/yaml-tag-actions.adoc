= Tag actions

A tag action instructs the analyzer to generate one or more tags for the application when a match is found. Each string in the `tag` field can be a comma-separated list of tags. Optionally, you can assign categories to tags.

[source,yaml]
----
tag:
  - "tag1,tag2,tag3"
  - "Category=tag4,tag5"
----

_Example_

[source,yaml]
----
- ruleID: test-rule
  when:
    <CONDITION>
  tag:
  - Language=Golang
  - Env=production
  - Source Code
----

A tag can be a string or a `key=val` pair, where the key is treated as a tag category in {ProductShortName}. Any rule that has a tag action is referred to as a “tagging rule” in this document.

[NOTE]
====
Issues are not created for rules that contain only tag actions.
