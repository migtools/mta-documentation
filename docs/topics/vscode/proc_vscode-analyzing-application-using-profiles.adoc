= Running an application analysis by using a profile

[role="_abstract"]
You can run a static code analysis of an application by using a profile that is available in the {ProductShortName} Hub. When you connect to the Hub, {ProductShortName} downloads the analysis profiles and custom rules present in the Hub to `.konveyor/profiles` location in your hard disk. You can use the analysis profile that contains custom rules to perform analyses in your Visual Studio Code IDE environment.

When you connect to the Hub, the profile configuration options in your IDE instance are disabled.
