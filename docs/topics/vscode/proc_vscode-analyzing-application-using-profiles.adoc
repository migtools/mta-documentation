[id="analyzing-application-profiles_{context}"]
= Running an application analysis by using a profile

[role="_abstract"]
To run a static code analysis of an application, you can use a profile that is created and managed by your architect in the {ProductShortName} Hub. The centralized configuration management standardizes the analysis configuration and custom rules across projects to produce a consistent result. This allows the architect to create and manage the necessary profiles, thereby simplifying the lifecycle of analysis configurations and rules. Migrators can run analyses either by using local profile configuration or by using profiles from the Hub.

When you connect to the Hub from your Visual Studio Code instance, {ProductShortName} downloads the analysis profiles and custom rules present in the Hub to the `.konveyor/profiles` location in your hard disk. You can use the analysis profile that contains custom rules to perform analyses in your Visual Studio Code IDE environment. If you connect to the Hub, the profile configuration options in your IDE instance are disabled.

.Prerequisites

* You opened a project written in one of the supported languages in your VS Code workspace.
* An architect has configured an analysis profile in the Hub.

.Procedure

. Click the {mta-dl-plugin} extension and click *Open Analysis Panel*.

. Click *Configure Hub Settings* in settings (image:settings-icon.png[]).

. Configure the following settings on the *Hub Configuration* page:
.. Enable *Hub*.
.. Enter the {ProductShortName} user interface URL in the *Hub URL* field.
.. Enable *Skip SSL certificate verification* if you want to connect to your Hub without verifying the local SSL certificate in the host. 
.. Toggle *Enable authentication* on to log in to your Hub.
.. Enter the username and password credentials of the {ProductShortName} user interface.
.. Enable *Solution Server* to use the solution server to suggest resolutions for the issues in the source code.
.. Enable *Profile Sync* to sync the profiles with the Hub. {ProductShortName} periodically downloads the latest version of the profiles from the Hub. {ProductShortName} does not update the profiles and rules if you do not sync the profiles with the Hub.

. Select a profile from the list on the *{ProductShortName} Analysis View* page.
. Click *Run Analysis*.
