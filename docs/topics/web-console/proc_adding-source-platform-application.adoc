= Associating an application with a source platform

[role="_abstract"]
You can associate applications that you created in {ProductShortName} with their Cloud Foundry (CF) instances by configuring the application's coordinates in the source platform. 

The specific coordinates vary depending on the source platform you select. For example, the coordinates for CF instances are *name* and *space*. 

.Prerequisites

* You configured at least one source platform instance in the *Administration* mode.

.Procedure

. In the {ProductShortName} user interface, select the *Migration* mode.
. On the *Application Inventory* page, click the edit icon (image:icon_edit.png[]) in an application. The *Update application* dialog appears.
. Enter the following information in the form:
. Click *Source platform* and enter the following fields:
.. *Source platform*: Select a source platform instance.
.. *Source platform coordinates*: Configure the source platform coordinates in either way:
... Enter the source platform coordinates in the fields. For example, *name* and *space* for a CF instance.
... Enable the source platform coordinates to enter application coordinates in JSON. For example, a CF instance coordinates can be:
+
[source, json]
----
{
    "name": ["example-app"],
    "space": ["example-space"]
}
----
.. *name*: Type the name of the application.
.. *space*: Configure the CF space in which the app is deployed in the source platform.
. Click *Save* and close the *Update application* dialog.

.Verification

To verify that the coordinates you configured are saved in {ProductShortName}:

. Click anywhere on the appication row to open the application details view.
