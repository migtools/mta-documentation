= Configuring a target profile

[role="_abstract"]
A target profile contains one or more generators, with each generator generating assets for different migration paths. A migrator can create and track the target profiles for a specific archetype on the *Archetypes* page. You can configure more than one target profiles for an archetype based on the target platforms to which you want to migrate applications of the specific archetype.

//what does priority order mean?
The generators are run in a priority order, in which manifests generated by lower priority generators do not override manifests generated by other generators.
