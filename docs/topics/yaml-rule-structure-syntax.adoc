= YAML rule structure and syntax

[role="_abstract"]
Rules are written in YAML. They consist of:

* metadata
* conditions
* actions

Rules instruct the analyzer to take specified actions when given conditions match.

A YAML rule file in {ProductShortName} contains one or more YAML rules.

  - "label3="
  # subdomain prefixed key
  - "konveyor.io/label1=val1"
